For now the easiest way to add and deploy a new migration is to move the other folder out of the project.

So if working on Windows, either delete the Postgres folder or move it out of the project.  Then do
the migration work and deploy to the database.  Then move the folder back into the project.

I'll need to investigate a better solution at a later point.
